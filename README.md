Current status
========================================================
The current site located at `orchardchildcare.ie` is in need of a rewrite. Right now, the site is completely static with all the content hard coded. The design is a minimal bootstrap3 template which includes some (possibly badly chosen) Google fonts. What makes matters worse is that the whole thing is a Wordpress theme. We don't want to use Wordpress any more.

========================================================
Proposed improvement
========================================================
The site needs content management, so, I propose to use the very promising `Prismic.io` content management API which offers the client a intuitive content editing experience and allows me to simply access the content fragments. This leaves development completely open ended in terms of technology.

Current status
========================================================
The current site located at `orchardchildcare.ie` is in need of a rewrite. Right now, the site is completely static with all the content hard coded. The design is a minimal bootstrap3 template which includes some (possibly badly chosen) Google fonts. What makes matters worse is that the whole thing is a Wordpress theme. We don't want to use Wordpress any more.

========================================================
Proposed improvement
========================================================
The site needs content management, so, I propose to use the very promising `Prismic.io` content management API which offers the client a intuitive content editing experience and allows me to simply access the content fragments. This leaves development completely open ended in terms of technology.

========================================================
Re design
========================================================
The site needs to be redesigned. Since content is going to be managed externally via `Prismic.io`, I would like to merge the page sections together. Allow me to explain, if you go to `orchardchildcare.ie`, you will notice that the Customer reviews are littered throughout the one page layout. I would like to move these all together. I want clearly defined sections and a simple layout. The site must still feel like a marketing pitch though.
